                                had no seniors to look up to or seek guidance
                                from about what to expect from the industry. So

                                about his personal experience in the industry as

                                through the same dilemma that many students go
                                through. He was initially planning on doing MBA
                                but never had any answer as to why he wanted to
                                go for it. He attempted GATE in his pre-final
                                year just for trial and to his surprise got a
                                very good score. This is when he realised that
                                he was actually zealous about the technical
                                aspects of CS and started preparing sincerely
                                for GATE and aced it.

                            <p class="mb-0 text-justify">After getting into IIT,
                                Delhi, Mr Gupta realised that the gap was huge
                                and it is how most students feel when they get
                                into one. He says that he had very limited
                                knowledge about the world then and felt like a
                                ‘nobody’. There were people who already had
                                start-ups and had far more knowledge than him.
                                He got to know of many ‘unknown unknowns’ –
                                things that he never knew existed. But in spite
                                of these hurdles, the exposure he got from an
                                expanded industrial view and knowledgeable
                                professors and peers that helped shape his
                                career.

                            <p class="mb-0 text-justify">Mr Gupta said that the difference lies in maintainability.  In former, the code is written with the intention of running only once but in the latter, the code stays – it needs to run for a long time, has a lot of cost and serve millions. It is the main investment of company. So the code has to be extensible and sustainable.

He also states that the coding skill tested in interviews and the coding to be actually done after getting the job are little different. But, as Mr Gupta says “Coding is fitness” via which the interviewers judge the skills.
                                He says that the work culture in Amazon is tough. People need to be open to learning as there will be a lot of challenges. The code written goes through a strict and thorough review process and also performance, stress and load testing before getting pushed into the main line. 
                                There are a lot of teams that work on different components and layers of code that gets executed when processing a request.
