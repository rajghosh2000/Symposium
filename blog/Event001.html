            </h2>
            <p class="mb-0 text-justify">Our first speaker, Loopasmita Deka, is currently working as a Software Development Engineer (SDE) in Walmart Labs, India. She had also worked in Intel as an SDE for over 2.5 years. She graduated in B.tech, Computer Science and Engineering from Tezpur University in 2017.  She is a strong engineering professional having worked in the information technology and services industry.
              The session covered many topics which gave us an insight into what the industrial world holds for us.  The speaker focused on keeping our basics strong which includes data structures, algorithms, logical thinking and puzzles, system design, database and many more. She stated that the interviewer mainly tests our knowledge on these subjects because this is the least they can expect from a fresher who wouldnâ€™t have much knowledge of the industry work culture.  She emphasised on practising problem solving using the knowledge of the above mentioned topics which would help us to easily crack an interview.
              How should we prepare ourselves for a technical interview?</p>

            <p class="mb-0 text-justify">
              <strong>1.</strong>	Master a particular programming language (preferably  Object Oriented Programming (OOP) languages).<br>
              <strong>2.</strong>	Practice coding on white paper/text editor.<br>
              <strong>3.</strong>	Try solving problems in various online coding platforms like HackerRank, Leetcode etc.<br>
              <strong>4.</strong>	Should focus on solving problems within a given time limit.

              <span class="section-heading-lower">What to Do!</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-0 text-justify">It is not always necessary to solve a problem correctly, rather, the interviewer mainly focuses on the approach. Therefore, it is important to clearly demonstrate the approach used to the interviewer(s).<br><br>
              It is important for one to be updated with the trending technologies in order to survive in an industry and this is helpful for getting a job in FANG like companies. Some of the helpful tools include version control- Github etc., IDE-Eclipse etc. and unit testing. 
              Our speaker also highlighted importance of soft skills and how it helps us in connecting with the interviewers and also to get through an interview.<br><br>
              To applying for off-campus jobs, one needs to build a strong resume, register in job sites like LinkedIn, Naukri to stay updated and connected and build a good alumni connection.
              Our speaker also mentioned about the different types of companies - Product based companies and service based companies. The compensation as well as the work culture varies enormously. The software profiles are development, testing and operation. The prior knowledge of it is essential before stepping into an industry.
              The session had covered 90% of the skills one needs to develop in order to crack an interview to get into big companies. It was indeed an informative, insightful and successful event.
